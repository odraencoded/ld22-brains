Brainssssss....
... is a Ludum Dare 22 entry.

A simple 2D zombie apocalypse game.

Controls:
Moving around: Up, Down, Left, Right
Shooting: Ctrl, Shift or Space (protip: don't use space)
Play: Enter

On top left there is your brain counter, if your brains are all nommed on, you lose.
On top right there is your zombie counter, pretty standard.

There are ten levels in total, and a bonus level if you exterminate all zombies!
