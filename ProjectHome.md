Brains!!! is a Ludum Dare 22 entry, a make a game in 48 hour competition.
It's a simple top down zombie shooter. Includes simple graphics and simple game play. Play in ten sort-of randomly generated generic purple city levels, fight against hordes of green things coming after your brain counter that you can only assume are zombies. Survive this trial and earn a highscore that is not stored in anyway and you will forget about thirty seconds later.

This game requires [OpenAL](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx) to run. Those beepity boopity amazing sound effects won't play themselves without it. (also the game will crash without the beepity boopity sound effects.)
